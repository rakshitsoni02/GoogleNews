# Android MVVM Starter Project  üí™

This repository helpful to understand recommended architecture by google, Followed by Google I/O  ‚ù§Ô∏è  [guidelines](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html)  written in Kotlin

## Why Stater?  ü§î
This repo is helpful to kick start any high-level project. Easy to customize and integrate with other libraries.
I've used a simple & clean approach to integrate  [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)  to show the latest content from Google News. It uses  [Retrofit 2](http://square.github.io/retrofit/)  to fetch the news from the API(https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html)

## Configure & Run the app  üöÄ

-   Go to  [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)  and generate an API key (It's only 2 steps!)
-   Create new file ->  `credentials.properties`
-   Add the API key as shown below:  `NEWS_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"`
-   Run the app
-   hit run button  üéâ
